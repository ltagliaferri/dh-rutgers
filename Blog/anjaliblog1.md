I enjoyed this week’s readings, mainly the reading on podcasts which envisioned podcasts as a way to tell stories about space, draw attention to things we might ignore otherwise, especially if podcasts are the soundtracks to us driving, running errands, working out etc. This idea of public humanities as augmented reality is often what I see as a common thread in public  humanities especially art work or pieces situated in public places. I love the idea of a podcast that matches the commute time of a train, explaining the history of said train. Risam’s piece advocating for an interest in code was both engaging and tense for me as someone who grew up being told to learn to code over doing humanities work, and who was originally a comp sci major. I appreciated her finding a balance between the two, although I wondering how we define this balance,  is it using code to enhance humanities work or coding to ensure humanities is valued in data storytelling.
