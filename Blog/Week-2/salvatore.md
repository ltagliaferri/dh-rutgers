# Second Blog Post: Wrestling with Technology
This week I was made very aware of the occasional struggle I have with technology. The downloading of software and installation on my machine are not always cut and dry -- one of the side-effects of running open-source -- but in the end, when *victory* is achieved, it is so rewarding. 

Then, of course, there is the dreaded "profile creation" and "settings game" whereby tweaks and adjustments are necessary to get things *just right.* Perhaps that is the part I find most challenging. I like things to be simple. Find what works best, then run it into the ground (this also goes for clothes, btw). Too many choices can be paralyzing, at least for me. 

I strongly believe in the open-source community and wish I had the ability to contribute instead of merely reaping the benefits. Time, I guess that's the element that's missing. I just don't have the time. 

But to return to my original point, one thing which is certain is that everytime I run into a bit of a problem I learn something. Sometimes I learn a lot, sometimes a little, but there is always something. I walk away from every challenge with a bit more knowledge.

Turning to something we read this week, the idea of archiving the internet is more fascinating than most people probably realize. I think the general population takes it for granted that there is a permanent footprint of everything posted online, but that just isn't necessarily so. Perhaps more interesting, at least from my point-of-view, is whether or not it is *necessary.* Do we truly need a record of everything written or said online? Do we need a record of every book every written? Do we need a copy of every Sears Catalog? This is the first time I am considering this question, and much to my surprise I'm not sure the answer is yes. 

There can certainly be collectors. Collectors collect. Today, however, the vitriol with which people attack others for something written or said years earlier is shocking. Perhaps at times a shorter memory could be beneficial. Perhaps we can let the past go sometimes. Learn from it and move on. I just don't know.
