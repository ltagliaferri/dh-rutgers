# First Blog Post: Looking Back, Thinking Ahead
Where to begin? 

Times, they are a changin'. It's easy to take for granted all of the technology available at our fingertips today, therefore I find it useful to occasionally stop and think back to a different time. A time before all of this. A time when messages were sent in envelopes, a stamp neatly affixed in the upper right corner, senders and recipients both eager with anticipation. A walk to retrieve one's mail from a PO Box in the Rutgers' Post Office (does it still exist?), hoping grandma sent a few dollars hidden inside a meticulously folded letter telling you to treat yourself to a meal but full-well knowing it was going to be spent on beer. What does grandma do now? Venmo? Bitcoin? The remarkable thing is all of this wasn't so long ago. 

In any case, enough looking back. Let's cast our eyes forward. This is exciting. I wish I had a nickle for every time I've heard: "Digital Humanities... That's the future." Nevertheless, there certainly is a lot of truth in those words. The modern American landscape is soaked with opportunity. Anyone can publish their words and images on the web. All the tools are available open-source. Kids are given tablets and laptops at school, wifi is broadcast through the air. It's all free. Barriers to entry are disappearing. 

I'm not sure what role DH will play in my own work--mostly because I have no real idea of where I'm going--but I know it will be a factor. I'm already thinking of the possibilities of writing papers about cinema where clips are embedded and the reader can easily "see" what the article is referring to without having to search for the movie. My son would love nothing more than if I started included memes in my work. Perhaps that is how the two of us will collaborate.

Starting to figure some of this out. The future's bright. 

# Second Blog Post: Wrestling with Technology
This week I was made very aware of the occasional struggle I have with technology. The downloading of software and installation on my machine are not always cut and dry -- one of the side-effects of running open-source -- but in the end, when *victory* is achieved, it is so rewarding. 

Then, of course, there is the dreaded "profile creation" and "settings game" whereby tweaks and adjustments are necessary to get things *just right.* Perhaps that is the part I find most challenging. I like things to be simple. Find what works best, then run it into the ground (this also goes for clothes, btw). Too many choices can be paralyzing, at least for me. 

I strongly believe in the open-source community and wish I had the ability to contribute instead of merely reaping the benefits. Time, I guess that's the element that's missing. I just don't have the time. 

But to return to my original point, one thing which is certain is that everytime I run into a bit of a problem I learn something. Sometimes I learn a lot, sometimes a little, but there is always something. I walk away from every challenge with a bit more knowledge.

Turning to something we read this week, the idea of archiving the internet is more fascinating than most people probably realize. I think the general population takes it for granted that there is a permanent footprint of everything posted online, but that just isn't necessarily so. Perhaps more interesting, at least from my point-of-view, is whether or not it is *necessary.* Do we truly need a record of everything written or said online? Do we need a record of every book every written? Do we need a copy of every Sears Catalog? This is the first time I am considering this question, and much to my surprise I'm not sure the answer is yes. 

There can certainly be collectors. Collectors collect. Today, however, the vitriol with which people attack others for something written or said years earlier is shocking. Perhaps at times a shorter memory could be beneficial. Perhaps we can let the past go sometimes. Learn from it and move on. I just don't know.
